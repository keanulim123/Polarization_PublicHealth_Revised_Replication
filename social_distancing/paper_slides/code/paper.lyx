\begin_layout Abstract
\noindent
We study partisan differences in Americans' response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Political leaders and media outlets on the right and left have sent divergent
 messages about the severity of the crisis, which could impact the extent
 to which Republicans and Democrats engage in social distancing and other
 efforts to reduce disease transmission.
 We develop a simple model of a pandemic response with heterogeneous agents
 that clarifies the causes and consequences of heterogeneous responses.
 We use location data from a large sample of smartphones to show that areas
 with more Republicans engaged in less social distancing, controlling for
 other factors including public policies, population density, and local
 COVID cases and deaths.
 We then present new survey evidence of significant gaps at the individual
 level between Republicans and Democrats in self-reported social distancing,
 beliefs about personal COVID risk, and beliefs about the future severity
 of the pandemic.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Public messaging in the US during the coronavirus pandemic has diverged
 sharply along partisan lines.
 President Trump and other Republican officials have sometimes downplayed
 the severity of the crisis, while Democratic leaders have given more emphasis
 to its dangers (Beauchamp 2020; Stanley-Becker and Janes 2020; Coppins
 2020; McCarthy 2020).
 Similar divisions appear in partisan media (Aleem 2020; Kantrowitz 2020).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nationwide surveys mirror the partisan divisions in elite messaging—with
 Democrats reporting more concern about COVID-19 and higher levels of social
 distancing than Republicans (see Figure 1).
 However, Democratic areas have also had more coronavirus cases and implemented
 stay-at-home policies earlier.
 The raw differences observed on surveys could simply be the expected result
 of local differences in risk or regulation.
 Furthermore, prior evidence shows that apparent partisan gaps in beliefs
 can shrink substantially when there are moderate incentives for accuracy
 (Bullock et al.
 2015; Prior et al.
 2015).
 Beliefs about the number of casualties in Iraq or the presidential approval
 rating have, for most people, few direct consequences.
 Beliefs about the severity of the pandemic and choosing whether to social
 distance, on the other hand, may be a matter of life or death.
 We ask whether partisan gaps persist in the face of these large incentives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we combine GPS location data from a large sample of smartphones
 with a new survey to study partisan differences in the response to COVID-19.
 The GPS data are collected by the company SafeGraph, and record daily and
 weekly visits to points of interest (POIs), including restaurants, hotels,
 hospitals, and many other public and private businesses.
 Our primary analysis focuses on the period from January 27, 2020 to July
 12, 2020.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a simple model that clarifies the potential causes and consequences
 of divergent social-distancing behavior.
 It combines a standard epidemiological model of a pandemic with an economic
 model of optimizing behavior by heterogeneous agents.
 The model clarifies that divergent responses between groups need not be
 inefficient.
 One group might engage in less social distancing because their costs of
 distancing are greater (e.g., they would lose more income) or because their
 benefits of distancing are smaller (e.g., they are at lower risk of infection).
 However, differences in behavior resulting from divergent 
\emph on
beliefs
\emph default
 of otherwise similar agents do suggest systematic inefficiency, as optimizing
 based on different beliefs means that the marginal costs of social distancing
 are not equated across people.
 Achieving a given level of social distancing in society will be more costly
 when otherwise similar agents have heterogeneous beliefs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our main GPS results show that the strong partisan differences in social
 distancing behavior that emerged with the rise of COVID-19 are not merely
 an artifact of differences in public policies or observed risks.
 Controlling for state-time fixed effects to account for heterogenous policy
 responses by state governments only attenuates the partisan gap slightly.
 Including controls to proxy for local policy, health, weather, and economic
 variables interacted flexibly with time attenuates the gap more substantially,
 but it remains statistically and economically significant.
 After including our full set of controls, we estimate that moving from
 the 10th to the 90th percentile of Republican county vote share is associated
 with 11.5 and 15.2 percent increases in the number of POI visits during the
 weeks of April 6 and May 11, when social distancing and partisan gaps are
 at their respective peaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of control variables,
 excluding states with early COVID-19 outbreaks, or dropping highly populated
 counties.
 Replacing the continuous measure of partisanship with discrete indicators
 for portions of the Republican vote share distribution or restricting the
 sample to counties from certain portions of the distribution does not change
 our qualitative conclusions.
 Furthermore, there is no evidence of a similar partisan gap during the
 same period in 2019 conditional on the same set of controls.
 We find similar evidence of a partisan gap at the voting precinct level,
 but focus on county-level analyses due to limitations facing the precinct
 specification (see footnote 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fn:precinct_caveats"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To complement the data showing county-level differences in behavior, we
 use a nationally-representative survey to show that individual behavior
 and beliefs about social distancing are partisan.
 We collect participants' demographics (including party affiliation), beliefs
 regarding the efficacy of social distancing, self-reported distancing due
 to COVID-19, and predictions about future COVID-19 cases.
 Compared to Republicans, we find that Democrats believe the pandemic is
 more severe and report a greater reduction in contact with others.
 In our survey, we also randomly vary whether predictions about future COVID-19
 cases are incentivized.
 We do not find evidence that incentives reduce the partisan gap, suggesting
 that these predictions are less likely to be due to partisan cheerleading
 (as in Bullock et al.
 2015 and Prior et al.
 2015) and more likely to reflect true differences in beliefs.
 These partisan gaps in survey responses emerge even when comparing respondents
 within the same county.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of contemporaneous studies also measure partisan differences in
 responses to COVID-19.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Coverage in the media and some studies examine partisan heterogeneity in
 response to COVID-19 with no or few controls for differential risk exposure
 or costs of social distancing (e.g., Economist 2020; Andersen 2020).
 Baker et al.
 (forthcoming) use transaction-level data and examine heterogeneity in consumpti
on responses to COVID-19.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Gadarian et al.
 (2020), Makridis and Rothwell (2020), and Wu and Huber (2020) show that
 partisanship is a primary driver of attitudes about the pandemic and self-repor
ted behaviors in surveys, and Druckman et al.
 (2020) show that affective polarization colors people's evaluations of
 the U.S.
 government response to the pandemic.
 Cornelson and Miloucheva (2020), Grossman et al.
 (2020), and Painter and Qiu (2020) demonstrate partisan differences in
 response to state-level stay-at-home orders.
 Barrios and Hochberg (2020) show differences between Republican and Democratic
 areas in the frequency of COVID-related queries on Google and in movement
 patterns as measured in GPS data from a different source than the one we
 use.
 Fan et al.
 (2020) find differences in risk perceptions and social distancing in GPS
 and survey data across political parties and other demographics.
 Our results are broadly consistent with these other studies, but we believe
 that our paper contributes to the discussion through a unique combination
 of observational data analysis, survey work, and a theoretical model that
 helps understand the economic implications of our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ash et al.
 (2020), Bursztyn et al.
 (2020) and Simonov et al.
 (2020) find that people social distance less if quasi-randomly exposed
 to news sources that argue that COVID-19 is less risky, suggesting that
 media exposure is one possible driver for our results.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Pastor and Veronesi (forthcoming) also find that Democrats are more risk
 averse than Republicans.
 Differences in risk aversion would not explain the differences in beliefs
 we find in Section

, but are a possible complementary explanation for the observed partisan
 gap in social distancing.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work contributes to a broader literature on what drives responses to
 pandemics (e.g., Blendon et al.
 2008; Vaughan and Tinker 2009; Fineberg 2014).
 Mobilizing an effective public response to an emerging pandemic requires
 clear communication and trust (Holmes 2008; Taylor et al.
 2009; van der Weerd et al.
 2011; Vaughan and Tinker 2009).
 Risk perception, behavior changes, and trust in government information
 sources change as pandemics progress (Ibuka et al.
 2010; Bults et al.
 2011).
 Demographic characteristics, such as gender, income, geography, or social
 interactions, are important determinants of the adoption of recommended
 public health behaviors (Bish and Michie 2010; Ibuka et al.
 2010; Bults et al.
 2011; Chuang et al.
 2015; Shultz et al.
 2016; Gamma et al.
 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A related literature focuses on the consequences of political polarization
 for health behaviors (e.g., Iyengar et al.
 2019 and Montoya-Williams and Fuentes-Afflick 2019).
 Party affiliation is correlated with physician recommendations on politicized
 health procedures, enrollment in government exchanges created under the
 Affordable Care Act, beliefs in the safety of vaccines, and hurricane evacuatio
ns (Hersh and Goldenberg 2016; Lerman et al.
 2017; Sances and Clinton 2019; Trachtman 2019; Krupenkin 2018; Suryadevara
 et al.
 2019; Long et al.
 2019).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, our work relates to broader literatures on partisan differences
 in trust and beliefs (e.g., Bartels 2002; Gaines et al.
 2007) and adds to the increasing number of papers using GPS or related
 data to study social interactions (e.g., Dubé et al.
 2017; Chen and Rohla 2018; Athey et al.
 2019).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we present a stylized model to clarify why it might matter
 if different types of people choose different amounts of social distancing.
 We embed an epidemiological model of disease transmission into an economic
 model with agents who maximize utility considering the expected private
 cost of disease.
 We consider how heterogeneity in perceived risks affects aggregate welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Epidemiological Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use a discrete-time version of the standard SIR epidemiological model
 (Kermack and McKendrick 1927).
 In each period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, each person is in one of four states 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in\{S,I,R,D\}$
\end_inset

, representing Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased.
 The share of the population in each state at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 represent disease infectiousness, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 denote an individual's amount of risky behavior at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

—for example, the amount of travel, dining out, failing to wash hands, and
 other activities that increase the risk of becoming Infected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All people begin in the Susceptible state.
 A Susceptible person becomes Infected at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}\beta i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and stays Susceptible with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-c_{t}\beta i_{t})$
\end_inset

.
 Infected people stay Infected for one period, after which they become Deceased
 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 or Recovered with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\psi)$
\end_inset

.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are absorbing states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 index different types of people—for example, liberals and conservatives.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\theta\sigma t}$
\end_inset

 be a state variable representing the share of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that is in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The population is of measure 1, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\theta}\sum_{\sigma}\omega_{\theta\sigma t}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Individual Decisions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 earn flow utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\theta}(c_{t};\sigma_{t})$
\end_inset

, which depends on their risky behavior 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 and their state 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 People discount the future at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and maximize expected lifetime utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\tau=t}^{\infty}\delta^{\tau}u_{\theta}(c_{\tau};\sigma_{\tau})$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\theta}(\sigma)$
\end_inset

 as the expected lifetime utility of a person currently in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

; note that this also implicitly depends on current and future population
 states 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\theta\sigma t}$
\end_inset

.
 Being infected reduces utility, so we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\theta}(S)>V_{\theta}(I)$
\end_inset

 for any given current population state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on Susceptible people, as they comprise most of the population
 during the period we study and are the people who face a trade-off between
 the benefit of consumption and the risk of becoming infected.
 We can write their maximization problem as a Bellman equation, in which
 people maximize the sum of utility from risky behavior today and expected
 future utility:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\theta}(S_{t})=\max_{c_{t}}\left\{ \underbrace{u_{\theta}(c_{t};S_{t})}_{\text{current utility from risky behavior}}+\underbrace{\delta\left[c_{t}\beta i_{t}V_{\theta}(I)+(1-c_{t}\beta i_{t})V_{\theta}(S)\right]}_{\text{expected future utility}}\right\} .\label{eq:V}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The first-order condition for privately optimal risky behavior is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{u'_{\theta}}_{\text{marginal utility of risk}}=\underbrace{\beta i_{t}}_{\text{marginal infection probability}}\underbrace{\delta\left(V_{\theta}(S)-V_{\theta}(I)\right)}_{\text{private cost of infection}}.\label{eq:FOC}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-order condition shows that people choose their risky behavior
 to equate marginal benefit (more utility today) with private marginal cost
 (higher risk of infection, which reduces future utility).
 The equation illustrates that there are three reasons why risky behavior
 might vary across types.
 First is the marginal utility of risk (or equivalently, the marginal cost
 of social distancing): for example, people vary in how much they like travel
 and dining out, as well as in how easy it is to work from home.
 Second is the marginal infection probability: for example, local infection
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 differs across geographic areas.
 Third is the private cost of infection: for example, infection is more
 harmful for people who are older or have underlying health conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Social Optimum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult to know for sure whether people take too many or too few
 steps to reduce disease transmission during our study period.
 Thus, we do not consider the optimal consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, we hold constant the total amount of risky behavior and ask whether
 the allocation across types is optimal.
 Tangibly, this means that we are not asking, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how much social distancing should people be doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Instead, we are asking, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

holding constant the amount of social distancing people are doing, would
 some people ideally be doing less, and others ideally be doing more?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Social welfare is the sum of utility across all people in all states:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{t}=\sum_{\theta}\sum_{\sigma}\omega_{\theta\sigma t}V_{\theta}(\sigma_{t}).\label{eq:W}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 denote the total risky behavior at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 across all people.
 The (constrained) socially optimal outcome results from maximizing 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}$
\end_inset

 subject to the constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=\bar{C}_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 be the shadow price on that constraint; this reflects the loss from having
 too much or too little social distancing overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consuming 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 imposes two types of externalities.
 First, it imposes a positive pecuniary externality, as travel, dining out,
 and other risky activities help keep firms in business and workers employed.
 Second, it imposes a negative externality by increasing the person's infection
 probability, which increases the expected stock of infected people in the
 next period (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t+1}$
\end_inset

) and then increases other Susceptible people's infection risk.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{t}$
\end_inset

 denote the net externality per unit of consumption, which may be positive
 or negative; this becomes more negative as the contagion externality grows.
 We assume that these externalities are constant across people and that
 people do not account for the externalities when choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the constrained social optimum, Susceptible people's consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 would satisfy the following first-order condition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
0=\underbrace{u'_{\theta}-\beta i_{t}\delta\left(V_{\theta}(S)-V_{\theta}(I)\right)}_{\text{private marginal utility}}+\underbrace{\phi_{t}}_{\text{externality}}+\underbrace{\lambda}_{\text{shadow price }}.\label{eq:FOC W}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

People who are not Susceptible do not account for transition risks.

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Heterogeneous Risk Misperceptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now allow people to misperceive risks.
 These misperceptions cause Susceptible people to choose too much or too
 little risky behavior relative to their private optimum, and heterogeneous
 misperceptions cause transfers across types and efficiency losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now add 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 subscripts to explicitly denote different parameters by type.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{t\theta}:=\beta i_{t}\delta\left(V_{\theta}(S)-V_{\theta}(I)\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 consumers then set

\begin_layout Standard

For illustrative purposes, imagine there are two types

 marginal utility is linear and the same for both types, so

 for both types and

 Finally, without loss of generality, assume type

 perceives greater risk, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}_{a\theta}>\tilde{\mu}_{b\theta}$

 Our survey data show Democrats perceive greater risk, so one can think

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{\mu}}_{t}:=\frac{1}{2}\left(\tilde{\mu}_{ta}+\tilde{\mu}_{tb}\right)$

 With homogeneous risk perceptions, both types would set

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u'=\bar{\tilde{\mu}}_{t}$

 With heterogeneous misperceptions, type

\begin{equation}
c_{tb}^{*}-c_{ta}^{*}=\frac{\tilde{\mu}_{ta}-\tilde{\mu}_{tb}}{-u''}.\label{eq:Difference in c}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These consumption differences cause both transfers across types and efficiency
 losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk perceptions affect risky consumption, and risky consumption causes
 externalities, so the heterogeneous misperceptions cause transfers across
 groups.
 The net transfer from type

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{t}>0$

 the positive pecuniary externality from risky consumption outweighs the
 negative contagion externality, then heterogeneous misperceptions cause
 a net transfer from type 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

\begin_inset Formula $a$

 Intuitively, we would say that Republicans are doing more to keep the economy
 going.
 On the other hand, if

Intuitively, type

 people (Democrats) are doing too much social distancing, and type

 Since the marginal cost of social distancing is increasing, society could

\begin_layout Standard
To supplement these data, we ran an online survey with a sample of American

 at the individual level.
 The survey was conducted from April 4-7, 2020 with Prime Panels from CloudResea

 We recruited 2,000 participants to complete the study.
 Participants are broadly representative of U.S.
 adults in terms of party affiliation, age, gender, and race.
 In addition, we weighted observations so that age, gender, and race distributio

 data (Gallup 2020).

The survey asked for demographic information (zip code, age, race, gender,
 income, education, number of children, and health characteristics).
 It then asked about news consumption habits and trust before and during
 COVID-19.
 Then, there were several questions about social distancing: self-reported
 social distancing in response to COVID-19, beliefs about the risk of not
 distancing, and the appropriate trade-off between going out more to help
 the economy versus going out less to avoid spreading COVID-19.

 Panels A and B illustrate a strong geographic correlation between the counties

 Mobility levels then fell until reaching a minimum during the week of April
 6-12, 2020, followed by a gradual recovery that remained below pre-pandemic
 levels as of July 6-12, 2020.
 Throughout this pandemic period, Democratic counties exhibited a larger
 drop in weekly POI visits than their Republican counterparts with this
 partisan gap generally growing over time.
 However, as Panel B demonstrates, Democratic counties also exhibited a
 larger rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

 This measures the extent to which these two groups' behavior diverges with
 the rise of COVID-19 via any of the aforementioned channels.
 Throughout February, there are no significant partisan differences in POI
 visits relative to the January 27 week baseline.
 However, as COVID-19 begins to emerge in the United States, partisan difference

 early July.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results do not control for differences in public policies, which themselve

 In Panel B, adding state-time fixed effects to control for state-level

 shocks causes the partisan differences to attenuate only slightly.

 We view the health controls as proxies for the marginal infection probability
 and the private cost of infection, and we view the economic controls as
 proxies for the marginal cost of social distancing, though each group of
 controls could proxy for other factors as well.
 We include these controls nonparametrically via indicators for decile bins
 within a week, which we interact with time fixed effects in order to allow
 the coefficients on these indicators to vary flexibly across time.
 Although these controls attenuate partisan differences, they remain economicall

 Appendix Figure

 shows that these strong partisan differences do not appear over the same
 time period in 2019 conditional on the same controls.
 These results are consistent with behavioral differences driven by partisan
 misperceptions of risks at the group-level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To better understand the magnitudes of this partisan gap, we compare the
 difference between very Republican and very Democratic counties to contemporane
ous mobility levels and to overall social distancing relative to January.
 The estimate of our partisan gap coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{t}$
\end_inset

 is 0.292 by the week starting April 6 (the week with the fewest number of
 visits) and 0.386 in the week starting May 11 (the week with the largest
 partisan gap).

\series bold
 
\series default
These estimates imply that going from a county with the 10th to the 90th
 percentile in Republican vote share is associated with 11.5 and 15.2 percent
 increases in the number of POI visits during these two weeks respectively.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The difference between the 90th and 10th percentile of Republican vote share

 The 11.5 percent gap during the week of April 6 corresponds to 6.5 percent
 of the total change in POI visits between the weeks of January 27 and April
 6, and the partisan gap during the week of May 11 is comparable in size
 to 15.0 percent of the total change in POI visits between the weeks of January
 27 and May 11.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Between the weeks of January 27 and April 6 (May 11), POI visits decreased
 by 64.0 (50.3) percent.
 We compare the fraction of this overall change equivalent to our 90th vs.
 10th percentile partisan gap: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{(0.115\times visits_{Apr6})}{(visits_{Jan27}-visits_{Apr6})}=0.115\times\frac{(visits_{Apr6}/visits_{Jan27})}{(visits_{Jan27}-visits_{Apr6})/visits_{Jan27}}=0.115\times\frac{0.360}{0.640}=0.065$
\end_inset

 The fraction of social distancing during the week of May 11 is similarly
 derived.

 The partisan gap in social distancing between very Republican and very
 Democratic counties is economically meaningful but only accounts for a
 limited portion of overall social distancing.

 Panels A and B use alternative sets of controls.
 Panel C replaces the measure of partisanship with a discrete indicator
 for certain quantiles of the Republican vote share distribution.
 Panel D drops counties that are very small (less than 3,000 people), very
 large (greater than 500,000 people), or are in states with early COVID-19
 outbreaks (California, Washington, and New York).
 Panel E restricts the sample to counties from certain portions of the Republica
n vote share distribution.
 Panel F weights observations by the county's population, uses standard
 errors clustered at the county-level, and examines sensitivity to the start
 date.
 Except when restricting to counties in the top half of the Republican vote
 share, none of the alternative specifications change the central conclusion
 regarding partisan differences in social distancing in March through at
 least early July.

We note several limitations of our precinct-level analysis.
 Due to the limited availability of 2016 precinct-level shapefiles, our
 precinct-level analysis includes only 42 states (see Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:poi_build_precinct"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Partisanship is measured at the precinct-level, while social distancing
 and our health, weather, and economic controls are generally measured at
 the census block group level.
 The latter set of variables are then mapped to precincts based on geographic
 overlap using the procedure described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:poi_build_precinct"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, potentially introducing correlated measurement error between our outcome
 and non-partisanship controls.
 Finally, POI visits are allocated to geographies by merchant location whereas
 partisanship is measured among residents.
 With smaller geographies, it becomes increasingly likely that visitors
 to a POI come from a different home geography, resulting in mismatch between
 visits and partisanship.

 considers alternative measures of social distancing derived from SafeGraph's
 Social Distancing data.
 Statistically significant partisan differences emerge in March through
 at least early July for the log number of devices leaving home, the log
 number of stops made in non-home census block groups, the log of the median
 time away from home (Panel A), and the share of devices leaving home (Panel
 B).
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A key issue with the SafeGraph social distancing data is sample attrition.
 SafeGraph restricts the panel to devices with observed location pings in
 a given time period.
 For some applications, the frequency of location pings depends on device
 mobility.
 If devices are immobile at home or turned off, they may not generate location
 pings and would then be dropped from the sample.
 The total number of active devices changes over our sample period in a
 manner consistent with sample attrition.
 Given these issues, we prefer measures of social distancing derived solely
 from 
\emph on
external 
\emph default
activity (e.g., POI visits) that do not contain the same measurement error
 problems.
 We attempt to correct for the differential attrition in our measure of
 the share of devices leaving home (see Appendix Figure

Turning to the results of our survey, we first conﬁrm that individuals’
 beliefs related to COVID-19 are strongly associated with their social distancin
g behaviors.
 We find that a one standard deviation (SD) increase in beliefs about the
 efficacy of social distancing, as described below, is associated with a
 0.323 SD increase in self-reported social distancing (SE 0.022; p < 0.001),
 controlling for demographic characteristics and state fixed effects.
 Similarly, a one SD increase in beliefs about the number of future cases
 in the US is associated with a 0.066 SD increase in self-reported social
 distancing (SE 0.023; p = 0.004).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we show that there exist individual-level partisan differences in
 (self-reported) social distancing behaviors and attitudes, consistent with
 the GPS analysis presented above.
 We then show that beliefs about the effectiveness of social distancing
 and predictions of the spread of COVID-19 follow the same partisan patterns.

 On average, participants report reducing contact by 70.0 percent, with a
 SD of 24.5 percent.
 After including controls, strong Democrats report engaging in 0.18 SD more
 contact reduction than strong Republicans.
 This corresponds to a gap in contact reduction of 72.1 percent for strong
 Democrats versus 67.8 percent for strong Republicans.
 Similarly, Democrats find it significantly more important to stay inside
 to prevent the spread of the virus versus go outside to help the economy,
 and the difference between strong partisans is 0.23 SD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then examine the partisan differences in underlying beliefs regarding
 COVID-19 severity and efficacy of social distancing.
 We find that Democrats' belief regarding the probability of catching COVID-19
 without any social distancing is higher than the analogous belief held
 by Republicans.
 On average, participants assess this probability to be 55.0 percent (SD
 31.9 percent).
 Strong Democrats believe this probability is 60.5 percent, which is 0.34
 SD larger than the 49.6 percent belief held by strong Republicans.

We next consider beliefs about future COVID-19 cases in the entire US.
 We tell participants the number of cases by March 31 and ask them to predict
 the number of cases in April.
 On average, participants predict 202,810 new cases in April 2020 (SD 233,343
 cases, due to a long right tail).

 Subjects' underprediction might be due to misunderstanding of exponential
 growth, generic overoptimism, anchoring (177,226 was given as the reference
 number for cases by March 31), or to some other factor.

 Bullock et al.
 (2015) and Prior et al.
 (2015) show that partisan differences on factual questions often shrink
 under incentives due to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 rather than differences in true beliefs.
 When we randomize whether subjects' predictions are incentivized for accuracy,
 we do not find evidence that the partisan gap decreases.

The gap slightly increases, though the effect is statistically insignificant.
 Regressing predictions on the interaction between party and incentives
 corresponds to the specification in our pre-analysis plan.

 This supports the view that Democrats and Republicans genuinely differ
 in their beliefs about the severity of COVID-19.
 Appendix Figure

 shows that comparing individuals within the same county produces qualitatively
 similar results, complementing the county-level partisan gap observed in
 the GPS analysis.
 However, since 21.5 percent of participants are the only participant from
 their county, statistical precision is lower and low-population counties
 are underweighted.

 from equation (

 We assume that agents have the same quadratic flow utility functions

If Republicans and Democrats disagree about the potential risks, they may
 also differ in how much they reduce the risk of disease transmission through
 social distancing and other actions.
 In this case, our model shows how society ends up with more disease transmissio
n at higher economic cost than if people had the same beliefs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our empirical results show that partisan gaps in beliefs and behavior are
 real.
 GPS evidence reveals significant partisan gaps in actual social distancing
 behaviors.
 Survey evidence shows substantial gaps between Republicans and Democrats
 in beliefs about the severity of COVID-19 and the importance of social
 distancing.
 The raw partisan differences partly reflect the fact that Democrats are
 more likely to live in the dense, urban areas hardest hit by the crisis,
 and to be subject to policy restrictions—in other words, to face stronger
 individual incentives for social distancing.
 Even after controlling carefully for such factors, however, the partisan
 gaps remain statistically and economically significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One explanation for these results is that media sources have sent divergent
 messages about the coronavirus.
 Appendix Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:partisan-news-control"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that the partisan gaps in the survey data are smaller when the partisansh
ip of news consumption is controlled for, and that news partisanship is
 statistically significantly correlated with beliefs even when party is
 controlled for.
 While our evidence does not permit us to pin down the ultimate causes of
 partisan divergence, these patterns are consistent with divergent messaging
 playing an important role in driving differences in beliefs and behavior.

\begin_layout Standard
To construct the county-level dataset used in the analysis, we proceed as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We begin by matching SafeGraph POIs to the counties in which they are located.
 We use latitude and longitude from SafeGraph's July 2020 Core POI dataset,
 along with the 2010 TIGER county shapefile.

\end_inset

 on July 24, 2018.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We successfully assign 99.9 percent of the POIs to a county.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge the POI-county mapping from (1) onto SafeGraph's Patterns
 data using the safegraph-place-id variable.
 We sum visits by county for a given day, aggregating across POIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge alternative county-day measures of social distancing onto
 the output from (2).
 These measures are constructed as follows from the Daily Social Distancing
 SafeGraph data with observations at the census block group-day level for
 January 27 through July 12.
 We exclude Alaska.
 We restrict our sample to census block groups with active devices throughout
 the entire time period.
 We also drop one census block group with anomalous behavior as notified
 by SafeGraph (FIPS: 190570010001).
 We aggregate this series to the county level.
 Countable variables (e.g., `device count') are summed, while we take a `device
 count' weighted average of other variables (e.g., `median home dwell time').
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge gridMET weather data onto the output from (3).
 Precipitation and temperature means for a given county day are taken as
 a mean across grid cell points that lie within a county boundary.
 Weather data was not available for Hawaii, so this particular state is
 dropped in regressions including weather controls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge The New York Times COVID-19 tracking data onto our output
 from (4).
 We assume zero cases and deaths for the observations not observed in The
 New York Times data.
 We drop the five counties associated with New York City and the four counties
 which overlap with Kansas City (MO), because The New York Times lists these
 as geographic exceptions where it either does not assign cases to these
 counties or excludes cases occurring within the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge a dataset of county-level shelter-in-place order start dates
 onto the output from (5) and construct an indicator for whether a county
 had been subject to a shelter-in-place order by a given date.
 This dataset of shelter-in-place orders is the same as in Allcott et al.
 (2020), where its construction is described in detail.
 It is ultimately sourced from Keystone Strategy, a crowdsourcing effort
 from Stanford University and the University of Virginia, Hikma Health,
 and The New York Times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then aggregate the output from (6) to the county-week level using sums,
 averages, or start- or end-of-week observations as appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge onto the output from (7) a dataset of county-level demographic
 information constructed as follows.
 We use the Open Census data from SafeGraph, aggregating up the data given
 at the census block group level to the county level.
 We combine this with data on county 2016 Presidential votes shares (MIT
 Election Data and Science Lab 2018).
 We define the Republican vote share to be the share of votes received by
 the Republican candidate over the sum of votes across all candidates.
 We exclude counties without valid vote data, which drops Alaska and two
 additional counties (FIPS: 15005, 51515).

 (1) in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:poi_build"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We use POI latitude and longitude along with 2016 precinct-level shapefiles
 (Voting and Election Science Team 2018).
 Of these POIs, we successfully match 99.6 percent to a unique precinct in
 the states covered by these precinct shapefiles and drop the 0.001 percent
 matched to two precincts.
 The precinct shapefiles cover the following 42 states: AK, AR, AZ, CA,
 CO, DC, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO,
 MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OK, OR, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA,
 WI, and WY.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We merge the output from (1) with the Patterns dataset from SafeGraph using
 the safegraph-place-id variable.
 We sum visits by precinct in a given week, aggregating across POIs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge alternative precinct-day measures of social distancing onto
 the output from (2).
 We start with the cleaned census block group level measures produced from
 (3) in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We then aggregate our (countable) alternative social distancing variables
 to the precinct level as follows.
 We do this by first constructing the geographic intersections formed by
 our precinct shapefiles and 2019 Tiger census block group shapefiles.

 We then form ratios (e.g., `share leaving home') using these summed precinct-leve

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge gridMET weather data onto the output from (3).
 Weather data by precinct day was constructed as a land area weighted average
 of weather data for overlapping census block groups.
 Census block group centroids were first associated with the nearest grid
 cell centroid in gridMET.
 Weather data was not available for Hawaii, so this particular state is
 dropped in regressions including weather controls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge The New York Times COVID-19 county-level tracking data onto
 our output from (4).
 Precincts were first associated with the county corresponding to the census
 block group of their largest intersection.
 We drop the five counties associated with New York City and the four counties
 which overlap with Kansas City (MO), because The New York Times lists these
 as geographic exceptions where it either does not assign cases to these
 counties or excludes cases occurring within the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 onto the output from (5).
 We construct an indicator for whether a county had been subject to a shelter-in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then aggregate the output from (6) to the precinct-week level using sums,
 averages, or start- or end-of-week observations as appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then merge onto the output from (7) a dataset of precinct-level demographic
 information constructed as follows.
 We start with the Open Census census block group level demographics from
 (8) in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:poi_build"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We then aggregate countable variables to the precinct-level using the intersect
ion share procedure described in (3).
 We then form ratios (e.g., `population density' or `share hispanic') using
 these summed precinct-level estimates.
 We then merge precinct-level 2016 Presidential votes shares (Voting and
 Election Science Team 2018) onto the resulting output, constructed as in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:poi_build"

 There is one exception, where the ID on Qualtrics did not correctly generate.
 We find exactly one remaining participant with the same demographics in
 the CloudResearch, so we keep this participant.

\begin_layout Enumerate
We change one miscoded age from .23 to 23 and one miscoded ZIP code from

 For analyses, we control for log(county cases + 1) and log(county deaths

 Often is coded as 1, Sometimes as 2/3, Rarely as 1/3, and Never/Not Familiar
 as 0.
 Answers are then multiplied by the pre-specified partisanship of each source
 (-1 for NYT; -2/3 for MSNBC; -1/3 for CNN; 0 for Network; 1/3 for WSJ;
 2/3 for Fox News; 1 for Breitbart).
 The weighted average of news partisanship for each participant equals the
 sum of (Answer * Source Partisanship) divided by the sum of Answer.
